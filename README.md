# NFI
Repository for graduation project at NFI

Contains the following Python files:

- classes.py: 

- data_prep_functions.py
- models.py
- plotting_6C_functions.py
- plotting_functions.py
- post_processing_functions.py
- reading_functions.py
- results.py
- training_functions.py
- write_to_csv.py

In a nutshell, data is read out by reading_functions.py, prepped for the neural networks in data_prep_functions.py. training_functions.py trains the neural networks in models.py on the data created. classes.py contains classes used throughout the project. Plotting happens in plotting_functions.py and plotting_6C_functions.py (for figures of all 6 dyes). results.py created some results needed for my thesis, write_to_csv.py created some results in data_for_github.
